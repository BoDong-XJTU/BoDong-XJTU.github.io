<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Bo Dong, a Senior Researcher at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU). I obtained my Bachelor's and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2005 and 2014, respectively. My research interests include big data knowledge engineering and trustworthy AI. I have led one major project under the National Science and Technology Innovation 2030 "New Generation Artificial Intelligence" initiative, one subproject of the National Key Research and Development Program, one subproject of the National Natural Science Foundation of China Key Program, one project under the National Natural Science Foundation of China Young Scientists Fund, one key research and development project in Shaanxi Province, and one young academic backbone cultivation project in XJTU. Additionally, I have been involved in four horizontal projects. The national intelligent tax analysis platform and cloud computing security monitoring platform I have contributed to have been applied in several provinces and cities.
